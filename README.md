# Single cell RNA sequence analysis
## Single cell RNA sequence analysis pipeline in R of kidney fibrosis dataset including quality control, normalization, clustering and visualization

This repository presents a complete end-to-end single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of the publicly available dataset GSE183276.

## The objective of this project are:

1. Establish scRNA-seq analysis pipeline
2. Investigate fibrosis-associated gene expression patterns
3. Identify cell types that are mostly affected
4. Compare Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD) vs Healthy controls
5. Determine molecular pathways that drive the disease
